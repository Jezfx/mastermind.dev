# [mastermind.dev](http://mastermind.dev) ✨

Sideproject which I'd like to start up. It'll eventually be a platform for developers to find small, niche [mastermind groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_group) for developers to share ideas, knowledge and teach. Its a good excercise for developers to go out and learn something new to input into the group, and also good for learning new skills from the others.

## Open for help

Right now, its a manual process of putting people in groups. However, I've got some good plans to automate it and run itsself. If its something you like the sound of and would like to get invoved I'd love to [hear from you 💌](mailto:jezfx.com).
